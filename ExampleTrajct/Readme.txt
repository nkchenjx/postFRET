The example trajectory is generated with Monte Carlo simulation at 1 ms resolution and then binned into 10 ms.

In the MATLAB file,
the first row of data is time, 2nd row donor counts, 3rd row acceptor counts, and the 4th row is FRET.

In the data files for vbFRET,
the first column is donor counts and the second column is acceptor counts. Data frequency is 1000 Hz for nonbinned data and 100 Hz for binned data.

In the data files for HaMMY,
The first column is time in unit second, the second column is donor counts and the third column is acceptor counts.

The files for vbFRET can be imported into SMART.
