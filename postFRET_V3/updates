postFRET V3 adapts an intensity-dependent Gaussian noise model for donor and accepter signal.
i.e., assume the sigma of the noise is linearly propotional to the average photocounts the signal.
This can be further developed to a noise model that carries both fixed Gaussian noise and intensity-dependent Gaussian noise in the future.
